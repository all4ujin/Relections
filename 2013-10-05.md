Weekly Reflection of Week 5 - 09/30/2013

Tuesday, I found out that there are three integrators (presenters) in our group including myself. We will be splitting into new vertical teams of four. Among our horizontal integrator group, we discusssed some things that would be important for us.

**What tools do we need?**
	Powerpoint, Word, Prezdi, Youtube, iPython notebook, Keynote, LaTex, Google Docs
	But for this assignment, we would specifically use iPython notebook or an HTML5-based presentation

**What skills should we develope?**
	Voice projection, public speaking, general speaking skills, practice with interacting with audience/questions
	
**What are our responsibilities?**
	Making presentations, practicing presentations, internalizing materials, communicating with the team, getting best practices, integrating visualization into presentations

**What are our outputs?**
	Presentation, in both physical and digital forms
	
**How do we communicate with other groups?**
	Github, IRC, email, Google Docs, Skype, Facebook, texts
	
**How do we share techniques as a group?**
	Presentation on Google Drive, email
	Our group thought it would be best to meet up in person after/before class

**What is our stack/workflow?**
	Get process/results from team, practice/present to them, get feedback on important points, bounce off other presenters

[Some Stochastic Models for Seismicity]
    Poisson
    Gamma renewal porccesses
    Weibull, lognormal, normal, dobule exponential
    ETAS
    BRownian passage time

    P(M>= 6.7 event by 2030) = 0.7 +- 0.1
    Two big stages
    
    
<Stage 1>
Determine regional constraints on aggregate fault motions from geodetic measurements.

Map faults and fault segments; identify segments with slip rate >= 1 mm/y. Estimate the slip on each fault segment principally from paeloseismic data, occasionally augmented by geodetic and other data. Determine (by expert opinion) for each segment a 'slip factor,' the extent to which long-term slip on the segment is accommodated aseismically. Represent uncertainty in fault segment legnths, widths, and slip factors as independent Gaussian random variables with mean 0. Draw a set of fault segment dimensions and slip factors at random from that probability distribution.

Identify (By expert opinion) ways in which segments of each fault can rupture
