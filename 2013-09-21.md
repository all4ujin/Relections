Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 3 - 09/16/2013

What good is a meadow?
It includes 1/3 of the plantation although it consists of 3% of the alpine region.
Water coming out from the SF tap is good for you! The Yosemite water is very clean.

Less snow is drying out the breeding pool that is affecting the habitat.
New disease is kiling the toads off. Too many horses via commercial pact 

1. Where are they in the park
2. How do we protect in the habitat

All limited data, all observational. No experiments since it is an endangered species. 
What is the existing data we got? We pulled together surverys from the past.
A detection history from the past 20 years. 


About 50% of the meadows have been visited. Given the data we have, 
Predict: GOod vs Bad toad breeding meadows
with: Meadow attributes

Elevation
Size
Vegetation types
Nearest meadow distance
Slope to nearest meadow

Remote sensing: 
snow
wetness
greenness
modeled precipitation

For every meadow what is the snow cover variablity.

Monthly wetness $ NDVI (Landsat data 30m) from 1986~2006. The reflective patterns. NDVI = greeness index
Red bar high= breeding. Using coarse data. 

Intrinsic Environmental Quality; is there well connectedness among toads?
Model breeding probability

US National Forest
Sued by: High Sierra Hikers
"Counter-sued" by packers association
Law suit that has a lot of culture things mixed into it. The Forest service lost the case.
The conservationst were upset about the horses grazing and having people make money out of the fragile habitat. 

How can you move from anecdote to evidence? 
Tadpools drying out :(((((

Is pack-stock use hurting toads? 
You can't look at one meadow, you have to look at the whole scale of the park.

Project:

Erros in toad detection: toads hiding and we didn't see them. Positives are real and negatives 
Erros reported stock use: people who gather info may not always be honest

Blend a simple predictive occupancy model with a permutation approach to: infer the effect of a rare stressor on a rare species (all else being equal)
