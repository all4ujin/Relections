Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 7 - 10/14/2013

I went to the California Academy of Sciences on Saturday, October 19th.
My sister and I watched a 30 minute documentary on earthquakes!

####Evaluation Mechanisms in Ptolemy by Chris Shaver

Useful programs: svg graphs, html5 presentations Easy to edit, small in size(all text), easily transfer to java or html

We need format that can last and reproducible in the future. Miscrosoft Word is not readable with other programms.

Concept of "generate" instead of product. Ex.A vector graph that's generated, can change easily VS. A picture done with Adobe Photoshop

CSEP, an earthquake study website that tries to make everything reproducible. Their reproducible procedure requires to download 30G of space and lengthy procedure that you can't copy and paste.

Youtube video: "Data Sharing and Management Snafu in Short Acts"

Ipython Notebook presentation by Aaron Relying on live data can be dangerous: data updates, shutdown, program updates
Extract eathquake data from CSEP
Dropping Nan, how to drop? The row or cloumn, use "dropna" to filtered data Important to save new data as a new name.
Useful to know "JSON vs. Python Syntax"
Open Knowledge Foundation: BibServer
Assignment: For Curation and Visualization, if in the other groups, pick one to join.

####Geospatial Innovation Facility: Campus resource

UC Support:
* Training & adivinsg
* Hardware & software
* Workspace, events

Application Development:
Building sophisticated applications.
Visualize climate change on map: http://cal-adapt.org
Land Carbon Atlas: http://landcarbon.org

Conceptual Model:
Event Database & Baseplayer

####Free Spech Movement
Berkeley in the 60s film. 
SF Treasure Hung on Chinese New Year. Solve puzzles leading to geographical location.

aww this looks really cute, actually

####Professor Stark's Lecture notes
__Main takeaway__: 

Shall I compar thee to a game of cards?
Though art less predictable and less temperate = predictable.
- William Shakespear

__The Rabbit Axioms__ 
Takeaway: 


 -   Use possion for main events. How would you define main events?
 - Gamma renewal. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
 - ETAS. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
- 
+<Test>
+- We don't fit data. We can use simulation to calibrate it
+
+<ETAS v Auto>
+- The simulation is from an ETAS model. The parameters came from a certain region in Japan.

__Seismicity Models__
Common Stochastic Models for Seismicity:
- Poisson. Clearly doesn't fit: to little clustering
- Posisson for "declustered" catalogs. Will pass test if you remove enough events, but standard algorithms don't (Luen & Stark)
-   Use possion for main events. How would you define main events?
- Gamma renewal. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
- ETAS. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
<Test>
- We don't fit data. We can use simulation to calibrate it

<ETAS v Auto>
- The simulation is from an ETAS model. The parameters came from a certain region in Japan.


__What's ETAS?__
<Epidemic-type aftershcok sequence>
- Heuristic: some events are unpredictable "background" mainshocks
- Some are aftershocks
- Aftershocks 


__Gutenberg-Richer law for magniudes__

- Best-fitting parameter b varies rgionally; typically different in aftershock sequences from "overall" best b.
- There is an argument whether b is greater than or less than 1.
- ETAS turns this into a probability density:
-  p(
- the important thing is that it is a constant that decays exponentially in magnitude

__Omori-Utsu law for aftershocks__
- difference in # of 


__ETAS untangled__
- assumes background is Poisson
- treats G-R and O-U rates as if they were probability distributions
- magnitudes are independent of everything else
- special case of Hawkes modesl
- Can be unstable (infinite afterschocks if p<=1)
- Can have very long burn-in times (if p<2, which it usually is)
