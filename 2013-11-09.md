Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 10 - 11/05/2013

###Tuesday
A nice overview of what we have done since last Thursday.

I am almost close to overcoming the flu! Despite all this, I kept up with the e-mail threads for presenters and went to my new vertical group meeting on Sunday night from 10pm to 11:30pm.

Earthquake combined with conditional intetnsity = many aftershocks

There's a library in R for ETAS.

Future plan: weekly meeting of presenters. First one to be in Thursday after class.
Problem: TOO MANY E-MAILS! not all are relevant..

Basic skeleton graphs ready and time series graphs in R is also ready. We need to know what parameters the data curators/analyzers (group #2 amd 3 of analyzers) have to give us.
