Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 3 - 09/16/2013

I went to the Friday office hours held by Chris and Kristina. While I had some clarification on adding my name on hw1 (all I had to do we click on "README" and then edit), I still had trouble downloading the ipython notebook onto my computer. I will go to the Sunday office hour. Also, I was still wondering if there is any way to check if Aaron could read my past reflections. Aaron, could you leave a note on the repos after you read recletions?

This week we had two guest lectures. I took notes in class to help me understand the topic that we will be covering for our project. Below are some important key concepts to take way from the guest speakers. 

Tuesday, September 17th - Toads in Yosemite
==========
Yoojin's Thoughts: Who would have thought about the importance of toads? When the guest speaker walked in with a red t-shirt "Toad Squad" it immediately grabbed my attention. I think it was a very well put presentation. 


A meadow includes 1/3 of the plantation although it consists of 3% of the alpine region.
Water coming out from the SF tap is good for you! The Yosemite water is very clean.

Less snow is drying out the breeding pool and it is affecting the habitat.
New disease is kiling the toads off. Too many horses via commercial pact 

1. Where are they in the park
2. How do we protect it in the habitat

All limited data, all are observational. No experiments since the toad is an endangered species. 
What is the existing data we got? We pulled together surverys from the past.
A detection history from the past 20 years. 

About 50% of the meadows have been visited. Given the data we have, the follwing model:
Predict: Gdod vs Bad toad breeding meadows
With: Meadow attributes
    Elevation
    Size
    Vegetation types
    Nearest meadow distance
    Slope to nearest meadow

Remote sensing: 
    snow
    wetness
    greenness
    modeled precipitation

For every meadow what is the snow cover variablity.

Monthly wetness NDVI (Landsat data 30m) from 1986~2006. The reflective patterns. NDVI = greeness index
Red bar high= breeding. Using coarse data. 

Intrinsic Environmental Quality; is there well connectedness among toads?
Model breeding probability

US National Forest
Sued by: High Sierra Hikers which was "Counter-sued" by packers association
Law suit that has a lot of culture things mixed into it. The Forest service lost the case.
The conservationst were upset about the horses grazing and having people make money out of the fragile habitat. 

How can you move from anecdote to evidence? 
Tadpools drying out :(((((

Is pack-stock use hurting toads? 
You can't look at one meadow, you have to look at the whole scale of the park.

Project:
Erros in toad detection: toads hiding and we didn't see them. Positives are real and negatives are uncertain
Erros reported stock use: people who gather info may not always be honest or accurate

Blend a simple predictive occupancy model with a permutation approach to: infer the effect of a rare stressor on a rare species (all else being equal)

Thursday, September 19th - Earthquake
==========
Yoojin's Thoughts: This is a very interesting topic. Since there is no proven method of predicting earthquake, it would be nice to study on how the exisint methods work. I think, soon (in the next 20 years) a smart group of scientists will devise an accurate prediction model. By then, theyw ould have a lot of data.

youtube link that there's no way we can predict earthquakes: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYlW4oIzVAY

Clustering in Space:
About 90% of large events in "ring of fire"
Most earthquaeks are on pre-exisintg faults
Depths 0-700km; most are shallow; most large quakes are shallow
Clustering in time: Foreshocks, afterschokcs, swarms = they have no real definition (classified only after earthquake)

GLobally, on the order of 1 magnitude 8 earthquake per year.
Locally, recurence times for big events 0(100y).
Big quakes deadly and expensive.
Much funding and glory in promise of prdcition.

Claimed precursors:
    foreshocks, patterns
    electromagnetics in ground and air; resistivity
    cloud formations
    infrared
    well water compostiion, temperature and level
    geodetics
    animal behavior: cockroaches on sensor

Some stochastic models for sismicity:
    Possion (most commonly used) marked = an event has a label
    Gamma renewal processes
    Wibull, lognorma, normal, double exponential,...
    ETAS: Epidemic-Type Aftershock Sequence - background rate of earthquakes. used quite often in Finance. genrations of aftershcocks
    Brownian passage time

Weather predicitons: look at sets of assignments. Scoring rules.

Coin Tosses - What does P(heads) = 1/2 mean?
    Euqlliy likely outcomes: nature indifferent; principle of insufficient reason
    Frequnecy thoery: long-term limiting relatvie frequency
    Subjective theory: strength of belief
    Poability models: property of math model; testable predcitions
