Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 13 - 11/25/2013


There was a lecture on Tuesday and a survey due on Wendesday to determine grades.
I am happy of what I have and hope to maintain it. So far I have learned on a lot not just on the material that we are using but how to work in a large group. I wish we had a class facebook group instead of an IRC. I know that IRC is something that Aaron wanted us to use more often but I did not use it quite often myself... Facebook is just more user-friendly in my opinion.
It will be hard to see where we left off after we come back from the long break. But I definitely look forward to what we have when we meet again on Tuesday.


Happy Thanksgiving!
