Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 6 - 10/07/2013


__Group1__:
* analyzed: learning style (learning), where did you gain experience in the languages (personal)
* curation in python, data analysis in R, visualization in python, presented in iPython Notebook
* takeaways: comfortable being specialist versus comfort being generalist, the two types of people working together

__Group2__:
* analyzed: learning style, any relationship between how people learn and roles they take on in groups
* focused on reproducibility and consistency in coding
* takeaways: collaboration and passing tasks along

__Group3__:
* made presentation on Thursday 
* used R (reproducible)
* didn't use ipython nor html5 for presentation
* why R? sat133 prepared us to how to use R. referred to questionairre
* the group did not ask in person to instructor -> risky to make that choice
* learning how to use markdown

__Group4__:
* curation in python, removed data that wasn't there
* roadblock, need to run VM
* saw no relationship between learning styles
* takeaways: groupwork, stepping up, maybe students didn't know how to fill out the survey
* had suggestions around technical leads in each group

__Group5__: Our group
* DII = Data Information Insight
* question about how to explain positive correlation
* used HTML

__Group6__:
* focused on reproducibility
* roadblock: home directy
* many empty cells were taken off
* don't see a trend
* not enought time since everyone was busy

__Group7__:
* learning style & classes taken
* divided the presentation into 3 parts: data, analysis, visual
* no significant relationship; p-values were very high
* lots of graphs, scatter plots, matrix - good work, visualizer!
* everyone communicated online
* cleared out the unicode - which is very hard by Aaron
* very clear speaker
* violin plot - presenter wasn't sure. what should we be taking away?
 
__Group8__:
* Objective: try to find meaningful patterns from the data
* step by step presentation
* no significant patterns found
* most people were kinesthetis learners
* facebook chat communication
* major roadblocks

__Group9__:
* unique process 
* one person short (didn't have a curator)
* meeting later than they should have. the group was able to abstract processes away. didn't have time to clean up the data
* leaned a lot on one of the group member who majored in CS

__Group10__:
* used HTML5 for presentation
* used R as well
* no particular patern found with the first visualization
* histogram from learning style score
* strong relationship between # of lanugages and those who were categorized as entrepreneurs
* facebook chat, e-mail communicated - e-mail was not the most effective way
* lot of obstacles: could not meet up even once
* which graphic was the biggest take away: word cloud _not the most expected type of visualization_ unique!

__Group11__:
* divided the presentation between two people
* biggest take-away: perfection is the enemy and reproducibilty is the key
* distribution of VARK scores 
* word cloud was very crowded
* actuary was the most popular post-grad plan


On Thursady, we clustered into groups to reproduce other groups.
Reproducing odne for group 2, 3, 5, 9, and 11.
Problems we ran into:
1. Authentication. Did not use my code
2. Did not know hw to get the data from the first place
3. Couldn't open ipython notebook code
4. missing dependencies or missing arguments. (our group got an error while trying to reproduce group 6's repository)

Our group struggled with trying to get ipython to work. I understood the concept of using virtual box and running the codes not on my computer but it was a bit tricky to follow instructions.
We also discusses some things that we think we did well and others that we could have improved on. I really liked working with my vertical group - they were responsible, dedicated, and collaborative. We started with the project on Tuesday when we first recived it and met toegether after class on Thursday. We may have struggled with some technical things like using R instead of ipython. I think for the sake of reproducibility, we should have read the direction more carfeully and used ipython. I think we were too nervous in the beginning but that quickly disappeared after we met with Aaron and found out about his expectations.

Things tht I think our group did well: we scheduled office hours with bCal. 
Roadblocks for project: using ipython. making the graphs makes sense! 
Future recommendation for our group: do not make assumption that everyone has the data! make it as reproducible as possible.
What will I do differently: Markdown, providing better instructions for our github
What group dynamic would we change? Perfect group dynamic.
