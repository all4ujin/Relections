Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 4 - 09/23/2013

Tuesday class was mainly focused on downloading iPython on our laptop.
Thursday class was directly related to what we will be covering for the rest of the semester - What are your thoughts on reproducibility? For it or against it? What logical reasons do you have to be for it or against it? What is the strongest justification for the opposite view?

There are 4 stages in data science: 
    1) observation 
    2) get data
    3) data uses for analysis
    4) analysis builds model.
Then after we got the model, we can use it to predict observation or data.

However, nowadays it can be difficult to duplicate one's analysis process because we all have different software with different versions on different systems, and by using the virtual box, we created an "contain" environment that can be duplicated.

Moreover, there can be harmful codes and other potential problems with running python codes from an open source, and they could destroy our personal files and data if we don't contain them in an enclosed environment.

They also talked about the importance of exactness in the real world, on example being how airplanes always use the same
microchip, meaning on an airplane, after its microchip broke, it will be replaced by the same microchip that is produced at the same time as the microchip that broke.
