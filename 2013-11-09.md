Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 10 - 11/05/2013

###Tuesday
A nice overview of what we have done since last Thursday.
I am almost close to overcoming the flu! Despite all this, I kept up with the e-mail threads for presenters and went to my new vertical group meeting on Monday night from 10pm to 11:30pm. We got a lot of understanding done that night. 

<Couple of materials we went over in class>
Earthquake combined with conditional intetnsity = many aftershocks
There's a library in R for ETAS.

Future plan: weekly meeting of presenters. First one to be in Thursday after class.
**Problem***: __TOO MANY E-MAILS!__ not all are relevant.. I found a way on github to "unwatch" or "ignore" it

Our group progress as of Tuesday:
* Basic skeleton graphs ready and time series graphs in R is also ready. 
* We need to know what parameters the data curators/analyzers (group #2 amd 3 of analyzers) have to give us. 
* We talked after class with the data curators/analyzers and decided that we will be getting data straight from group A! Kristina did not seem to approve of this because they liked how organic the initial chart the presenters drew in class. We admit that it is more simplistic but for the overaching goal of the class, we assured her that it will work better.
* Discovery! ETAS is not the best package to use: https://github.com/stat157/background/issues/26


**To-Do as of Class**
1. Coordinate with Luen for presentation on the 12th 
2. Figure out parameters for various models. Figure out what data (years) we’re using [2 options]. We can use Luen’s advice and other various resources (e.g., data lab) in order to answer domain-specific questions about seismology
3. A member of each group will meet weekly to sync up
4. Send out all of these notes & presentations


###Thursday
I'm really happy how the class is running. The students are leading the class which is great!
I know that grades are not everything bu I can't get rid of the idea on how do I show what I have done to do well in this class?

Dividing group work
* Receiving presenter e-mails but acting as visualizer in group


###Personal goals
* (Accomplished) Attend python workshop on Saturday, November 9th from 2pm to 5pm.
  * My notes are available for people who were not abale to make it: https://github.com/stat157/background/issues/31
* (In progress) Set up a group time
  * Made a group when2meet
  * **Roadblock** soliciting response was the hardest...
* (Accomplished) Made a presenter repo
  * There was nothing under the presenter repo so I made this  :) https://github.com/stat157/presenters
  * I sent out an e-mail to the presenters to fill out their git id
