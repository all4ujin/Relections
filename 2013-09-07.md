Weekly Reflection of Week 1 - 09/02/2013

1) It has been a while since I have coded. 
I had a github account since 2011 but I rediscovered that I had an account through Stat 157 class. 
Because I am a visual learner, I have tried looking up in Youtube again to make sure if I were doing things right. 
(Creating a repository in Github: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMsWq3rS6Po) 
Some things that have not worked were poking aroudn the github website. 
While interesting, it did not provide me with the answers I needed. 
I really need to ask a fellow class mate or a more experienced person for help. 
It is quite depressing how much of CS I forgot… Another trouble I had understanding was IRC. 
Thankfully, wikipedia provided me a very clear description.  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat)

2) It was more of an "Uh-oh" moment. 
Everything seemed to be running fine until I realized I do not know how to work my way around Github. 
My advice to a friend? Stay after class for extra help! 
Unfortunately, I had another class I had to make it to. 
But from next week, I will set a time to stay after class - hopefully, on Tuesday.

3) If I could start this week over, I would have borrowed someone else's Mac…Missing out on the hands on experience during class made me struggle through the hw a bit longer. 
From now, my fixed Mac will do its job in class. 
Definitely advise others to read over the concepts online. 
When I first learned about forking, I did not quite get it. 
(https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) I will have to read more about it. 
It seems like a way to copy an original file and making edits to it without changing the original version.
