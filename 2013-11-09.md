Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 10 - 11/05/2013

###Tuesday
A nice overview of what we have done since last Thursday.

I am almost close to overcoming the flu! Despite all this, I kept up with the e-mail threads for presenters and went to my new vertical group meeting on Monday night from 10pm to 11:30pm.

Earthquake combined with conditional intetnsity = many aftershocks

There's a library in R for ETAS.

Future plan: weekly meeting of presenters. First one to be in Thursday after class.
Problem: TOO MANY E-MAILS! not all are relevant..

Basic skeleton graphs ready and time series graphs in R is also ready. We need to know what parameters the data curators/analyzers (group #2 amd 3 of analyzers) have to give us. 

* Discovery! ETAS is not the best package to use.

To-Do
1. Coordinate with Luen for presentation on the 12th
2. Figure out parameters for various models
Figure out what data (years) we’re using [2 options]
We can use Luen’s advice and other various resources (e.g., data lab) in order to answer domain-specific questions about seismology
3. A member of each group will meet weekly to sync up
4. Send out all of these notes & presentations


###Thursday
I'm really happy how the class is running. The students are leading the class which is great!
I know that grades are not everything bu I can't get rid of the idea on how do I show what I have done to get an A in the calss?


Dividing group work
* Receiving presenter e-mails but acting as visualizer in group


###Personal goals
* Attend python workshop on Saturday, November 9th from 2pm to 5pm.
