Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 9 - 10/28/2013

The biggest road-block I faced this week was "the FLU"! :(

On Thursday, we got together in our horizontal groups and discussed some problems that we faced and answers we came up with. A lot of people were confused on what we should do with ETAS (from Professor Stark's lecture) and how to take it from there.
Carl sent a link to Brad Luen's slides: http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~bradluen/slides.pdf

In essence, we were given a project in which we should be able to come with a more accurate earthquake predictor. While I know that there are many smart and innovative students in Berkeley, I think the scale of the project is too big. When I raised this concern to Christina, she mentioned that Aaron along with Chris and herself will be invovled in the project. That made me feel better. As of now, I plan to drop by Aaron's office hour on Sunday and see where I can do more work.
    
My biggest concern is that we were separted into a new group. In our group we have 2 visualizers and 2 presenters ( I like to call it integrators). For the past two days, I tried to arrange something so that we could all go to the Sunday office hour together. But no response... This is getting me really worried.
