Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 8 - 10/21/2013

I could not make it to class because of an interview on Thursday. My vertical group updated me that the class emphasized the importance of communicating across the horizontal group.

For this week, the biggest roadblock was understanding how to incorporate JSON into our code. I think we were left with more questions than answers on the Saturday office hour. Our vertical group intially thought that all we had to do was write a python code that will generate points on the california map. But we had to make sure that it was "reproducible" - in other words, that we could change a variable (location/state) and have the map and its appropriate data sets as outputs. I was hoping that we could find a way to do a world map (group 11 did a really good job with their code). I wish I had googled more and thought more about how to effectively execute this homework better.

I hope we were provided more resources to code. I tried codecademy but the colution does not correct my code. Thus, I don't know how to come up with a reader-friendly code. 

Here are some interesting searches I found on google for this assignment:
