Meeting with Joy and Ashley to prepare for next Thursday fair materials

###Thursday

The class focused on two parts: 1) collaborative science 2)reproducibility.
These were two things that was very new to me. 
For Thursday's science fair, the posters will be on the two points above.
I think the toughest part for the class would be simplifying and making the subject easy to understand to the audience.
Carl's honest wrap up saying that "at this rate, we will not have anything substantial on Thursday"

__How Do I Feel?__
* It started out with frustration. Pace of the class. 
* Communication among groups is hard
* There were many assumpitons like we knew the same thing

__What Did I Learn?__

__What Can We Come Up With?__

* 1 poster bout the class
* Video project

__How Do We Move Forward?__
