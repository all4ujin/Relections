Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 6 - 10/07/2013

Things tht I think our group did well: we scheduled office hours with bCal. 
Roadblocks for project:
Future recommendation for our group:
** What will I do differently: Markdown, providing better instructions for our github
What group dynamic would we change? Perfect group dynamic. We got too nervous in the beginning. Preliminary Setup Steps. 


__Group1__:
* notes not saved :(

__Group2__:
* notes not saved :(

__Group3__:
* made presentation on Thursday 
* used R (reproducible)
* didn't use ipython nor html5 for presentation
* why R? sat133 prepared us to how to use R. referred to questionairre
* the group did not ask in person to instructor -> risky to make that choice
* learning how to use markdown

__Group4__:
* notes not saved :(

__Group5__: Our group
* question about how to explain positive correlation
* used HTML

__Group6__:
* focused on reproducibility
* roadblock: home directy
* many empty cells were taken off
* don't see a trend
* not enought time since everyone was busy

__Group7__:
* learning style & classes taken
* divided the presentation into 3 parts: data, analysis, visual
* no significant relationship; p-values were very high
* lots of graphs, scatter plots, matrix - good work, visualizer!
* everyone communicated online
* cleared out the unicode - which is very hard by Aaron
* very clear speaker
* violin plot - presenter wasn't sure. what should we be taking away?
 
__Group8__:
* Objective: try to find meaningful patterns from the data
* step by step presentation
* no significant patterns found
* most people were kinesthetis learners
* facebook chat communication
* major roadblocks

__Group9__:
* unique process 
* one person short (didn't have a curator)
* meeting later than they should have. the group was able to abstract processes away. didn't have time to clean up the data
* leaned a lot on one of the group member who majored in CS

__Group10__:
* used HTML5 for presentation
* used R as well
* no particular patern found with the first visualization
* histogram from learning style score
* strong relationship between # of lanugages and those who were categorized as entrepreneurs
* facebook chat, e-mail communicated - e-mail was not the most effective way
* lot of obstacles: could not meet up even once
* which graphic was the biggest take away: word cloud _not the most expected type of visualization_ unique!

__Group11__:
* divided the presentation between two people
* biggest take-away: perfection is the enemy and reproducibilty is the key
* distribution of VARK scores 
* word cloud was very crowded
* actuary was the most popular post-grad plan


Clustered into groups to reproduce other groups.
Reproducing odne for group 2, 3, 5, 9, and 11.
Problems we ran into.
1. Authentication. Did not use my code
2. Did not know hw to get the data from the first place
3. Couldn't open ipython notebook code
4. missing dependencies or missing arguments. (our group got an error while trying to reproduce group 6's repository)
