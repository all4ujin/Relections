Weekly Reflection of Week 5 - 09/30/2013

Tuesday, I found out that there are three integrators (presenters) in our group including myself. We will be splitting into new teams. Among our vertical integrator group, we discusssed some things that would be important for us.

	*What tools do we need?*
	
	What skills should we dev?
	What are our responsibilities?
	What are our outputs?
	How do we communicate with other groups?
	How do we share techniques as a group?
	What is our stack/workflow?

<Some Stochastic Models for Seismicity>
    Poisson
    Gamma renewal porccesses
    Weibull, lognormal, normal, dobule exponential
    ETAS

    P(M>= 6.7 event by 2030) = 0.7 +- 0.1
    Two big stages
    
    
<Stage 1>
Determine regional constraints on aggregate fault motions from geodetic measurements.

Map faults and fault segments; identify segments with slip rate >= 1 mm/y. Estimate the slip on each fault segment principally from paeloseismic data, occasionally augmented by geodetic and other data. Determine (by expert opinion) for each segment a 'slip factor,' the extent to which long-term slip on the segment is accommodated aseismically. Represent uncertainty in fault segment legnths, widths, and slip factors as independent Gaussian random variables with mean 0. Draw a set of fault segment dimensions and slip factors at random from that probability distribution.

Identify (By expert opinion) ways in which segments of each fault can rupture
