Weekly Reflection of Week 2 - 09/09/2013

1) This week we have spent the whole class on Tuesday downloading Vagrant and going over the pros and deltas of the class on Thursday.
It was an important part to go over before all of us were deeply lost in the lecture. I was relived to find out that most of us felt the same way: we appreciated the instructor letting us work in groups but felt a serious need for clear direction of where the course is heading.
I plan to visit the Sunday office hour to make sure 1) I have done the hw properly 2) to see if I am going to do well in the course.

After Thursday, I went back on the TED website to watch Eric Berlow's simplifying complexity. He made an interesting point that "complex" and "complicated" are two different ideas. To me, something that is "complex" has a potential to grow into becoming "complicated." I really enjoyed his talk and wanted to know more how this topic will be integrated into our course. 


2) I did not have a particular "Aha!" moment yet. Aside from hearing what my classmates had to share about the pros and deltas of the course, there was little room for me to discover new things this week. One thing that I found helpful was when we were working in group on Tuesday, my teammates helped a lot in explaining things to me. 
 

3) Office hour! I want to know how we can use IRC to ask questions. From the Thursday class, it seemed not many people were using them to their advantage.
