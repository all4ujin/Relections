Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 7 - 10/14/2013

__I have little comments here and there on my class notes too__

I went to the California Academy of Sciences on Saturday, October 19th.
My sister and I watched a 30 minute documentary on earthquakes! I felt it was relevant to class.
It had a very cool visual. I thought the visualizers in the class would find it very helpful.

Thursday lecture was very interesting. 10:17am was the earthquake drill - but we didn't do anything...

HW2 is very frustrating. We are at Aaron's office hour that we scheduled for 11am to 12:20pm. We wanted to clarify what the assignment was about but he had another meeting at 12pm:(
What are we supposed to do?:( I think our communication was not successful this weekend. 

####Evaluation Mechanisms in Ptolemy by Chris Shaver

What is JSON: object notation. a seires of brackets and parantheses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON
Useful programs: svg graphs, html5 presentations Easy to edit, small in size(all text), easily transfer to java or html

We need format that can last and reproducible in the future. Miscrosoft Word is not readable with other programms.

Concept of "generate" instead of product. Ex.A vector graph that's generated, can change easily VS. A picture done with Adobe Photoshop

CSEP, an earthquake study website that tries to make everything reproducible. Their reproducible procedure requires to download 30G of space and lengthy procedure that you can't copy and paste.

"Data Sharing and Management Snafu in Short Acts": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4

Ipython Notebook presentation by Aaron Relying on live data can be dangerous: data updates, shutdown, program updates
Extract eathquake data from CSEP
Dropping Nan, how to drop? The row or cloumn, use "dropna" to filtered data Important to save new data as a new name.
Useful to know "JSON vs. Python Syntax"
Open Knowledge Foundation: BibServer
Assignment: For Curation and Visualization, if in the other groups, pick one to join.

####Geospatial Innovation Facility: Campus resource

####Free Spech Movement
Berkeley in the 60s film. 
SF Treasure Hung on Chinese New Year. Solve puzzles leading to geographical location.

aww this looks really cute, actually

####Professor Stark's Lecture notes

__Main takeaway__: 

Shall I compar thee to a game of cards?
Though art less predictable and less temperate = predictable.
- William Shakespeare
... I didn't think this quote was effective enough to start his presentation.

__The Rabbit Axioms__ 
1. For the number of rabbits in a closed system to increase, the syste, must contain at least 2 rabbits. 
2. No negative rabbits.
3. Freedman's Rabbit-Hat Theorem: You cannot pull a rabbit from a hat unless at least one rabbit has previously been placed in the hat
4. Corollary: You cannot "borrow" a rabbit form an empty hat, even with a binding promise to return the rabbit later.

__Applications of the Rabbit-Hat Theorem__
+ Can't turn a rate into a probability wthout assuming the phenomenon is random in the first place
+ Cannot conclude that a process is random without making assumptions that amount to assuming that the process is random. (__Something has to put the randomness rabbit into the hat.__)
+ Testing whether the process appears to be random using the _assumption_ that it is random cannot prove that it is random. (__You can't borrow a rabbit from an empty hat__)
+ Can't conclude a process is a stationary and random without assumptions strong enough to imply the process is random and stationary. Observing the process isn't enough.

__Rabbits and Earthquake Casinos__
What would make the casino metaphor apt?
1. the plysics of earthquakes might be stochastic
2. stochastic models might provide a compact, accurate description of earthquake phenomenology
3. stochastic models might be useful for predicting future seimicity

- unless you believe 1) Rbbit Theorem says you can't conclude process is random
- might still be useful to treat it as random for reason 2) or 3)
- we will look at 2) and 3) for several common models

- Use possion for main events. How would you define main events?
- Gamma renewal. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
- ETAS. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
 
<Test>
+- We don't fit data. We can use simulation to calibrate it
+
<ETAS v Auto>
+- The simulation is from an ETAS model. The parameters came from a certain region in Japan.

__Seismicity Models__
Common Stochastic Models for Seismicity:
- Poisson. Clearly doesn't fit: to little clustering
- Posisson for "declustered" catalogs. Will pass test if you remove enough events, but standard algorithms don't (Luen & Stark)
-   Use possion for main events. How would you define main events?
- Gamma renewal. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
- ETAS. Doesn't fit (Luen, 2012)
<Test>
- We don't fit data. We can use simulation to calibrate it

<ETAS v Auto>
- The simulation is from an ETAS model. The parameters came from a certain region in Japan.


__What's ETAS?__
<Epidemic-type aftershcok sequence>
- Heuristic: some events are unpredictable "background" mainshocks
- Some are aftershocks
- Aftershocks 


__Gutenberg-Richer law for magniudes__

- Best-fitting parameter b varies rgionally; typically different in aftershock sequences from "overall" best b.
- There is an argument whether b is greater than or less than 1.
- ETAS turns this into a probability density:
-  p(
- the important thing is that it is a constant that decays exponentially in magnitude

__Omori-Utsu law for aftershocks__
- difference in # of 


__ETAS untangled__
- assumes background is Poisson
- treats G-R and O-U rates as if they were probability distributions
- magnitudes are independent of everything else
- special case of Hawkes modesl
- Can be unstable (infinite afterschocks if p<=1)
- Can have very long burn-in times (if p<2, which it usually is)
- Takeaway: we have to use hundreds of years of data to predict the next two years.
