Weekly Reflection of Week 12 - 11/18/2013

I really appreciate getting feedback from Kristina.


_Hi Group #_

_Thank you to those providing individual responses and the group evaluation form. When one of the goals is, "Figure out exactly what our new goal is," this is where we can be of some help. Reena and Tim were working on the TSG and GG respectively from your page (https://github.com/ashleysia/TeamHASHTAG) and are now helping with analysis. We are glad that help is redistributing appropriately. From going over the evaluations, we have a few suggestions on how to redistribute to fit individual strengths and group needs:_

1) With David's interest in cleaning-up code, we suggest you check out the "Checking Group," which will be serving the role of helping our class live up to its "Reproducible" name. This can be done with code EVEN in its early stages.

2) Since Yoojin wants to code more, perhaps you would be interested in helping Group 2 develop the model. Optimization and coding is a challenge, and your expressed interests would greatly serve this development.

3) For Vincent, Ashley, and Raymond--what are ways that we can use visuals inspired by the d3 website, inspired by Eric Berlow "Simplifying Complexity"? Be innovative and creative. You don't have to master d3 to be a designer. HOW can we make visuals that are interactive, if you could do it any way you wanted to? Brainstorm ideas that will shape the directions the analyzers will go in--what parameters would you want to be conveyed in a single image? How to make it something beautiful that your friends/family would appreciate?

Let us know how these suggestions work for you and your group. We have a lot to be done, and your collective contribution is vital for the classes success!
