Weekly Reflection of Week 3 - 09/16/2013

What good is a meadow?
It includes 1/3 of the plantation although it consists of 3% of the alpine region.
Water coming out from the SF tap is good for you! The Yosemite water is very clean.

Less snow is drying out the breeding pool that is affecting the habitat.
New disease is kiling the toads off. Too many horses via commercial pact 

1. Where are they in the park
2. How do we protect in the habitat

All limited data, all observational. No experiments since it is an endangered species. 
What is the existing data we got? We pulled together surverys from the past.
A detection history from the past 20 years.
