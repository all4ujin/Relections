Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 4 - 09/23/2013

Tuesday class was mainly focused on downloading iPython on our laptop.
Thursday class was directly related to what we will be covering for the rest of the semester - What are your thoughts on reproducibility? For it or against it? What logical reasons do you have to be for it or against it? What is the strongest justification for the opposite view?

My opinion on reproducibility: For some reason, building off from someone else's code seems a lot like plagiarism. Even if the work of the original constructor is well recognized, I think the boundaries are vague to define how much input the original doer and that of the person who followed-up on the code. From my previous experience in CS61, I know that there was a big emphasis on team work and collaboration. However, I did feel that it was unfair for people to earn the same points for the project they each put in different effort into. One of the articles "Trust Your Science?" raised the concern about the credibility of work. I do not see how more people contributing increases the credibility.

There are 4 stages in data science: 
    1) observation (getting data)
    2) data uses for analysis
    3) use analysis to build model
    4) predict dadta using model
    
Nowdays, it can be difficult to duplicate one's analysis process because we all have different software with different versions on different systems. With virtual box, we creat an "contained" environment that can be duplicated.

Moreover, there can be harmful codes and other potential problems with running python codes from an open source, and they could destroy our personal files and data if we don't contain them in an enclosed environment.

Exactness is also a very important concept in the real world. 
Ex: how airplanes always use the same microchip so that it is easily replacable.
