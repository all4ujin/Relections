Stat 157 Weekly Reflections

Weekly Reflection of Week 11 - 11/11/2013

The class is beginning to get a better structure. With Chris and the presenter group's presentation on Tuesday and Thursday, our group hashtag has decided that we have completed our task. On Thursday, we joined the group Quakers to help out what they need. For now, they wanted us to understand what they have plotted on their github. I am really intrigued by the plot of aftershocks. If we can actually generate a model that optimizes "k" in the earthquake formula, that in itself would be a great accomplishment.

For goals as of now, I need to update my google doc about what I did the past week and read over the papers for better understanding.

I am glad we had sign in sheets on Thursday because I have noticed that some students are not showing up as much...

Just a side not I forgot to mention, I saw the notes the people who made it to the office hour updated. I wish someone had a wrap up session at the Tuesday class.
